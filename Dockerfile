######################## - DEPLOYMENT

# base plus packages needed for deployment. Could just install these in final, but then we can't cache as much.
# vim is just for debugging
FROM base AS deployment

# git-core because the app does "git commit", etc
# curl because the docker health check uses it
# procps because it is useful for debugging
# gunicorn3 for web server
# default-mysql-client for convenience accessing mysql docker container
# vim ftw
# jq because it is really useful, even for scenarios where people might have environment variables with json values they might need to use for configs. about 1MB.
# libpq5 in order to be able to use postgres at runtime

######################## - SETUP

# poetry 1.4 seems to cause an issue where it errors with
#   This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a
#   problem with poetry but with lazy-object-proxy (1.7.1) not supporting PEP 517 builds.
#   You can verify this by running 'pip wheel --use-pep517 "lazy-object-proxy (==1.7.1) ; python_version >= "3.6""'.
# Pinnning to 1.3.2 to attempt to avoid it.
RUN pip install poetry==1.6.1

# default-libmysqlclient-dev for mysqlclient lib
# libpq-dev in order to be able to poetry install postgres lib, psycopg2. See also libpq5 above in deployment image.
